She lives a block away and her name is Susan."  After dinner, William's dad took him aside. "Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years.. She's a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her."  William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, "Dianne said yes! We're getting married in June."

"Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister."  His mother just shook her head. "Don't pay any attention to what he says, dear. He's not really your father."
