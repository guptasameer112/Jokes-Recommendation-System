47," There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all  things mechanical.  After serving his company loyally for over 30  years, he happily retired.  Several years later the company contacted  him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with  one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and  everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In  desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so  many of their problems in the past.  The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying  the huge machine.  At the end of the day, he marked a small ""x"" in  chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,   ""This is where your problem is"".  The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The  company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his  service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The  engineer responded briefly:  One chalk mark                       $1   Knowing where to put it            $49,999  It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.

54," The Pope dies and, naturally, goes to heaven. He's met by the reception committee, and after a whirlwind tour he is told that he can enjoy any of the myriad of recreations available.  He decides that he wants to read all of the ancient original text of the Holy Scriptures, so he spends the next eon or so learning languages. After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from most recent ""Easy Reading"" to the original script.  All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The Angels come running in only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering, ""An 'R'! The scribes left out the 'R'.""  A particularly concerned Angel takes him aside, offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what does he mean.   After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, ""It's the letter 'R'. They left out the 'R'. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!""
